    "reply": "1. **Correct grammar:** \"Hi\" is the grammatically correct version in standard English.\n\n2. **Better version:**  \"Hi\" is perfectly acceptable.  \"Hello\" is a slightly more formal alternative.\n\n3. **Fluency (out of 10):** 7/10.  While understandable, the non-standard spelling (\"haai\") lowers the fluency score.  The pronunciation is likely fine, but the spelling is unconventional.\n\n4. **Natural reply:** \"Hi there!\" or simply \"Hi.\"  A more informal reply could be \"Hey!\"  The best option depends on the context and your relationship with the person.\n"
