    "reply": "1. **Correct grammar:** \"Can you say what my name is?\"\n\n2. **Better version:** \"What's my name?\" or \"What is my name?\" (The first option is more natural and concise in spoken English.)\n\n3. **Fluency (out of 10):** 7/10. The grammar is understandable, but the phrasing is slightly awkward.  The better versions are more natural and flow better in conversation.\n\n4. **Natural reply:**  \"Your name is Charan.\"  (Assuming the context of previous interactions).  If the context is unclear, a reply like, \"I believe your name is Charan, is that right?\" would be appropriate.\n"
